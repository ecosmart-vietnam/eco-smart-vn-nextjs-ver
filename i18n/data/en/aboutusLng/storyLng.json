The Macalester Entrepreneurship and Innovation Board recognizes and rewards individuals with innovative ideas and initiatives that benefit the communities they serve. I was fortunate enough to be awarded the prize, which was previously known as the Eco Heroes Campaign, for my proposal on Eco Smart Solutions, ultimately leading to the inception of the company."
